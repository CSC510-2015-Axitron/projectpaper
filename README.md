##Group 9 - Procedural Content
###Project Report

###Background
A large portion of game development time is spent on content development, from the time it takes to make the tools to create the content to create the content itself. In order to reduce the effort required to develop sufficient content to keep players happy, some developers have turned to Procedural content generation, in which content is produced via an algorithm. In his article [Nine Paths To Indie Game Greatness][indiegreatness], David Marsh recommends aspiring developers lean heavily on user-generated and proceudral content to keep development time down, citing another developer, Introversion Software, who cut their development time down from 3 years (Darwinia) to 1 year (DEFCON) by switching from hand-crafted content to publicly available and procedural content.
These algorithms are varied and can be quite complicated, taking up a significant portion of development time themselves. Not only this, but because the results of the algorithms are not always the same, the eventual product may not be exactly what the developer or player expect. Developers then either have to adjust their expectations accordingly or spend time fine-tuning the algorithms, usually some combination of both.
These difficulties are what our project hopes to take some measure of.

###Goals
Our goals with this project are twofold:
Firstly, to determine how difficult it is to produce the tools and content itself by hand and compare this to how difficult it is to produce procedural generation algorithms to produce content of acceptable quality.
Secondly, to make it easily possible to give both sets of content to users and determine what, if any, difference in game enjoyment these two methods result in via survey.
In order to accomplish these goals, we decided to use a simple maze game. We decided on this format because making a game engine to play mazes would be easier than a more complicated game. Not to mention, there is already a mountain of work on generating and solving mazes out there, which would make the procedural portion of the development process much quicker.
We can easily quantify how many man hours we spent on producing the tools and content for hand written content, as well as the time spent on creating procedural generation algorithms, since we have GitHub's issues and commit tracking systems. Quantifying how much users enjoy handwritten or procedural content is much more difficult to do, and so instead of attempt to do it ourselves, we've left it for another group of people to attempt using our game. A proof-of-concept system is enough, the later group can go in and expand upon our work if it is necessary to do so.
