###Goals
Our goals with this project are twofold: First, to determine how difficult it is to design the tools and content itself by hand an compare this with the difficulty of designing procedural generation algorithms that produce content of acceptable quality, and second, to make it feasible to deliver both sets of content to users, and determine via survey any differences between the users' enjoyment of the sets. In order to accomplish these, we decided to develop a simple maze game. We chose this format because we believe that making a game engine to play mazes was of more fitting scope than other options such as voxel-world games which can also greatly utilize procedural generation. This is combined with the fact that there was already a [mountain of work][mazealgs] available on generating and solving mazes, which greatly hastened the procedural portion of our development process.
Since we have GitHub's issue and commit tracking systems, we can easily quantify how many man-hours we spent manually designing content, including the development time of the tools we used, as well as quantify time we spent developing the procedural generation algorithms. Quantifying how much users enjoy handwritten or procedural content would be a much more difficult endeavor, so instead of attempting to do it ourselves, we left it for another group of people to play our game. We felt that a proof-of-concept system was enough, but a future group can expand upon our work if necessary.
