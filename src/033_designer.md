####Maze Designer

![designer](./img/maze-designer.png)

We built out a maze designer, as shown in the image above, basically to aid us in production of hand created mazes. Maze creation in code was incredbily tedious prior to its construction, so the idea was that if we were going to create even a tehe limited number of mazes that we have created to date we would need to have some tool to create them in a visual fashion. We found after its construction that it could actually become a feature of the game. In its current configuration users can log in on the main game page, design, and save the mazes they have created.

The great thing is that when a user is logged in he/she can see all of the mazes they have created in the levels menu. Hitting the levels button on the main page and opening My Mazes in the menu, shows all of a users mazes as shown in the image below:

Users can also share mazes that they have created using a maze nubmer. A user only has to click on the load button and add in the number of the maze to jump to their own or another users' maze. That function is shown below:

Maze numbers are created upon saving mazes in the designer. Looking at the image below you can see the number of the maze next to the text box at the top of the image.
