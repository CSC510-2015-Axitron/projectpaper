###Background
A large portion of game development time is spent on content development, from the time it takes to make the tools to create the content to create the content itself. In order to reduce the effort required to develop sufficient content to keep players happy, some developers have turned to Procedural content generation, in which content is produced via an algorithm. In his article [Nine Paths To Indie Game Greatness][indiegreatness], David Marsh recommends aspiring developers lean heavily on user-generated and proceudral content to keep development time down, citing another developer, Introversion Software, who cut their development time down from 3 years (Darwinia) to 1 year (DEFCON) by switching from hand-crafted content to publicly available and procedural content.
These algorithms are varied and can be quite complicated, taking up a significant portion of development time themselves. Not only this, but because the results of the algorithms are not always the same, the eventual product may not be exactly what the developer or player expect. Developers then either have to adjust their expectations accordingly or spend time fine-tuning the algorithms, usually some combination of both.
These difficulties are what our project hopes to take some measure of.
