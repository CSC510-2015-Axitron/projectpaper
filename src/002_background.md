###Background
A large portion of game development time is spent on content development, from the time it takes to make the tools to create the content, to the time it takes to create the content itself. In order to reduce the effort required to develop sufficient content to keep players happy, some developers have turned to procedural content generation, in which content is produced algorithmically rather than manually. In his article [Nine Paths To Indie Game Greatness][indiegreatness], David Marsh recommends to aspiring developers to lean heavily on user-generated and procedural content, in order to keep development time down. This is citing another developer, Introversion Software, who cut their development time down from 3 years (Darwinia) to 1 year (DEFCON) by switching from hand-crafted content to publicly available and procedural content.
The algorithms can be varied and quite complicated, and can take a significant portion of development time. In addition, because the results of the algorithms can vary, the resulting product may differ from what the developers' or players' initial expectations were. Developers must then either adjust their expectations accordingly, or spend time fine-tuning the algorithms. Usually, it is a combination of both. These are the difficulties our project hopes to take a measure of.
