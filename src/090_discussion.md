###Discussion
####Difficult in testing GUI
A lot of our project's functionality depends on the GUI working properly, which is difficult to test. We ended up making up a series of informal functional tests that one of the development team would have to work through manually if they felt like testing, but more often our testing process was even less formal than that. While working on a feature, each developer tended to only test new features added to the GUI, expecting old features to continue to work. This bit us a few times, with some new feature breaking old functionality. A tool to automate interacting with the GUI would be useful, but we found nothing easy enough to setup to justify the effort of setting it up.
####Prevalence of free resources
Much of our project relies on freely available cloud resources, namely Heroku, TravisCI, and GitHub. While working on this project we marveled at how easy it is to setup and deploy code in an automated fashion, all for free. We believe it's safe to say that software engineering has never been this easy to do right, and for free, with a minimum of in-house expense for small projects.
