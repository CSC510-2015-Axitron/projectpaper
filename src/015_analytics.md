####Analytics

This brings us around to the final piece of our infrastructure: Analytics.  To prove or disprove the hypotheses set forth in this paper we needed data.  Extracting users likes or dislikes can be challenging, but we chose a very simple mechanism to get, store, and analyze this data.  When users visit the site they are presented with a randomly chosen maze, that can be either procedurally generated or hand-written.  Upon finishing a maze the user is asked for a binary opinion on the maze.  

We have utilized a service called [Keen IO](https://keen.io/ "Keen IO") to capture this information.  It stores a large amount of information on clicks for either like or dislike including the time of the click, IP information, and simple geolocation data.  We store also whether the maze was procedural or not and whether they liked the maze.  Then that information is stored on keen.io's servers in a relational database that is easy to query and generate visualizations from.  We have created a simple visualization that uses this click data and that can be seen [here](http://axemaze.herokuapp.com/pie.html "Pie Chart").  Obviously the game has not been played by real users out in the wild and the only opinions that are currently represented in the graphs are our own opinions.  Luckily the system allows us to quickly dump all stored data if we should end up having real users and can begin to store their information.
