###Conclusion
Both procedural and hand crafted content provide their own challenges of implementation. Some of our favorite games include both, and from our small experience in creating both, we feel it's safe to say that a mix of both is the best path for an aspiring developer.
Without being able to say for certain that people tend to prefer one or the other, we can say with certainty that hand crafted content is time consuming, but procedural content can become in turns "samey" or unpredictable, depending on how much time was spent on tuning the generator. Reigning in a procedural generation engine to exact specifications is, however, very time consuming, almost on the same level as producing enough content by hand, so excessive tuning is also not the answer. Thus, a balance of both is the best use of a devloper's time, using procedural engines for portions of the game that don't need to be very carefully tuned and handcrafted content for portions that need to be exacting.
