###Future Work
We did not have the time or resources to deploy our application to the world at large to record useful statistics, therefore we recommend another group inherit our code and attempt to do so. We utilized several services that may or may not continue to give out time for free if used on a large scale, so another service, or self hosting, may be required, which would necessitate changing our codebase slightly.
In addition, we did not have enough time to create enough hand-crafted content to reduce the chance of a user seeing the same maze twice, therefore we also recommend that whoever resumes work on this project also make more mazes.
